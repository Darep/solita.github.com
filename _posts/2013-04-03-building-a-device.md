Back in January, we finally set up a proper device lab, a coordinated organ for all the (mobile) devices we need to test our work. Before, our testing was all over the place, uncoordinated, confusing, inefficient and caused people to just skip testing with other devices. We had a somewhat-okay array of devices, but nobody knew what they were, or where they were. This is a chronicling of our journey to fix this problem.

### Planning a lab

When I realized we had a problem with our test devices, I formed a plan: to establish a small laboratory within our organization called "Device lab". The lab would have its own space where people could come and test their glorious creations on the spot &ndash; or take the devices with them (borrow). I self-appointed myself as the "Head Caretaker of the Device Lab" and to recruited two assistants to aid me. Our tasks would be to dictate lab rules, make sure everything keeps running smoothly and keep the device lab healthy and up-to-date.

I sent my plans to a few higher-ups. The head of IT was quick to respond, and in the end I basically just sent a list of devices that we should have at our disposal, based on our current and projected needs. The devices started slowly arriving on my desk. After a few days I had the absolute minimum viable device lab up and running, with a few iPhones, iPads and an Android phone. After few more weeks, I had my fantasy roster of devices. I also acquired a few extras by accident, like a Nokia N900. Given time, I also got hold of all the devices we already had, but which had been "lost" :)

### No room to test on-the-spot

Unfortunately, our office was, and is currently, a bit crowded. There was no room to place the devices in a way that people can stay and test their projects on the spot. Thus, the lab isn't actually a lab, but a shelf near my workstation where people borrow devices from. But some day, some day&hellip;

Borrowing a device is very simple. We use a notebook and a pen. Whenever someone borrows something, they write down the device(s) they borrowed, their name, the project and the date they intend to return the device. This way others will know where the devices are and when will they be back at the lab.

### Summary

The device lab works great. People are happy and complaints about not having test devices are long gone. Our overall software quality has also gone up, because testing with different devices is easy and accessible to everyone.

The lab also has an internal wiki page with all the information in it: basic idea, rules, list of people to contact, and a list of devices with names and specs.

Oh, yeah! The notebook + pen system isn't without its faults. If you want to borrow an iPad and it's missing, browsing through the notebook, to see who has it, is tedious. Instead, I've been thinking about having a single piece of paper per device and clipping them together. This way people only have to find the correct paper (very easy) and then look at the latest entry (also easy). Device lab version 1.1.

One final note: To keep track of each individual devices, we put name tags on them. Our IT uses things from film and TV for inspiration in naming things, like this [list of Pokémons][pokemons], and I wanted to follow this tradition. So, the devices are named after the [Twilight characters][twilight-characters], thus also spawning a secret alias: "The Twilight Lab".

Special thanks to device lab assistant Juha Höyssä for sparring and doing some of the device lab chores. Also, big thanks to [@viljamis](http://twitter.com/viljamis) for establishing the [Helsinki Open Device Lab](http://devicelab.fi/), which actually gave me the inspiration on how to solve the problem.
